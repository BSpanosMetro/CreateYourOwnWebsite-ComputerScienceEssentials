  <p> 
    Here at the Erwin Shrödinger Memorial Cat Daycare, we like to create an 
    environment for your cats that is simultaneously safe and unsafe, so that you can
    feel both confident in their health and well being as well as fearful for their lives
    while you go about your daily business. With our professionally trained and 
    completely amateur staff, your cats are in both good and bad hands.
