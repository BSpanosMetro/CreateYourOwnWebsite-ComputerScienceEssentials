  <p> At our fine establishment, we like to pride ourselves on the quality of our facilities. Hence, we have chosen not to keep cats in crates as many similar establishments do. Instead, we keep all of the cats in a steel box also containing a geiger counter with some radioactive material, connected to a vial of hydrocyanic acid, all in honor of the memory of Doctor Shrödinger's memory. </p>
