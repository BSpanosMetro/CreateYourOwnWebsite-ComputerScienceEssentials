  <h2>Alb</h2>

  <h3>Founder & CEO</h3>
  
  <p>
    Albert, who we fondly refer to as Alb, has been with us for many years after forming 
    this establishment. After the passing of his dear friend and debate partner Erwin, 
    he formed this daycare in his memory and that of his wonderful thought experiment 
    where he placed a cat in a box. Now approaching his 145th birthday, we look 
    forward to many more years of his dedication to this organization.

  <h2>Marie</h2>

  <h3>Veterinary Specialist</h3>

  <p>Marie has been with the daycare for almost as long as Alb has. Due to her personal expertise and studies in the field of radioactivity, she was seen as the perfect person to look after the physical health of the cats. Nearing the age of 157, we can safely say that we have enjoyed her aid in our persuits of cat care.</p>
